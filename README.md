BurpSuite Pro Python Extension

Some examples for implementing your custom burpsuite scanner issues through the jython extension.
This basically is a python version of the CustomScannerChecks example from http://blog.portswigger.net/2012/12/sample-burp-suite-extension-custom_20.html
(with some other tweeks)
After working it out a python version of it, I thought others might benefit.
